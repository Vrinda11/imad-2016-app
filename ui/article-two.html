                        <p>Beauty lies in each and every detail.Every thing that we enounter in life,every sphere of this earth and every dimension it follows has something beatiful about it.Sometimes it amazes me to see the perfection in this imperfection.If we are filled with gratitude about everything we live a more happy life and a more fulfilled one.


                        </p>
                        <p>
                      There is something positive and beautiful in each of us.If we care to look,if we care to find we would be
                      flabbergasted by the things that we can find in the world,in people,in nature,in everything.One just needs to change the outlook and approach in life and accept oneself.BUt never stop changing and learning because in growing there is beauty.In the end life is beautiful ,so we should enjoy it with a happy smile.                    </p>
