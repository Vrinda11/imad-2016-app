                        <p>"To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often."-Winston Churchill
                           Change is scary,risky and sometimes dangerous.We all are afraid of it.All afraid to try it,try new things,try something profound and striking.Unless we have a sense of comfort we arenâ€™t confortable.It requires great courage,confidence and bravery to step out of our confort zone.The best secret to change is just to no think and do,
                            trust your guts,trust your instincts and you are half way to success.If you believe your brain knows that it
                          be done and so it works and acts accordingly.

                        and working out the plan requiresd.One need to be more imaginative,creative and expand one's horizons.One needs to be bolder in one's pursuits and there should be adequate time bound implementation of actions.
                        <p>
                        "Action speaks louder than words".Thus with a serene,calm,stable,purified mind one should strive for one's goals and face adversity with determination and will power.                        </p>
